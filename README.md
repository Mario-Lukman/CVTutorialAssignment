# Real-Time Local Face Recognition

This project implements a real-time face recognition system that can identify individuals from an expanded dataset using a local webcam. This project fulfills the requirements of the "Face Detection and Recognition" assignment, focusing on dataset expansion, local environment implementation, and real-time testing.

dataset/: Contains the image datasets for each person to be recognized. Each person has their own subdirectory (e.g., Person1, Person2, YourName). Ensure each subdirectory contains at least 10 sample images.
model/: Stores the trained face recognition model (eigenface_pipeline.pkl) generated by train_model.py.
main.py: The main application script that captures video from the webcam, performs face detection and recognition using the trained model, and displays the results.
train_model.py: This script loads the image data from the dataset/, trains the face recognition model, and saves it to the model/ directory.
requirements.txt: Lists the Python packages required to run the project.
README.md: Provides an overview of the project and instructions for setup and usage.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

Python 3.x
pip (Python package installer)

Install the necessary Python libraries using the requirements.txt file:
pip install -r requirements.txt

#### Installation

Clone the repository (if applicable):

git clone [your_repository_url]
cd your_project

Install the required Python packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

1. Expanding the Face Dataset:
   In the dataset/ directory, you should have subdirectories for at least three individuals: Person1, Person2, and more. Ensure each subdirectory contains at least 10 .jpg or .png image files of the respective person's face.

2. Training the Face Recognition Model:
   Navigate to the project directory in your local terminal.

Run the train_model.py script:
python train_model.py

This script will process the images in the dataset/ directory, train the face recognition model, and save the trained model to model/eigenface_pipeline.pkl.

3. Running Real-Time Face Recognition:
   Ensure your webcam is connected to your local machine.
   Navigate to the project directory in your local terminal.

Run the main.py script:
python main.py

A window should appear displaying the live video feed from your webcam. Detected faces should be enclosed in bounding boxes, and recognized individuals should be labeled. Press the designated key (e.g., 'q') in the webcam window to close the application.

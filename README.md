# Real-Time Local Face Recognition

This project implements a real-time face recognition system that can identify individuals from an expanded dataset using a local webcam. This project fulfills the requirements of the "Face Detection and Recognition" assignment, focusing on dataset expansion, local environment implementation, and real-time testing.

## Project Structure

dataset/: Contains the image datasets for each person to be recognized. Each person has their own subdirectory. Ensure each subdirectory contains at least 10 sample images.

model/: Stores the trained face recognition model (eigenface_pipeline.pkl) generated by train_model.py.

main.py: The main application script that captures video from the webcam, performs face detection and recognition using the trained model, and displays the results.

train_model.py: This script loads the image data from the dataset/, trains the face recognition model, and saves it to the model/ directory.

requirements.txt: Lists the Python packages required to run the project.

README.md: Provides an overview of the project and instructions for setup and usage.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

##### Python 3.x
##### pip (Python package installer)

Install the necessary Python libraries using the requirements.txt file:
##### pip install -r requirements.txt

## Dataset Preparation
Go to this Kaggle dataset page:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/lfw-dataset/data

Download and extract the dataset to your computer.

Pick at least 6 people who have at least 10 images each.

Copy those people's folders into your project's dataset/ directory

## Installation

Clone the repository (Exclude the file Results.png as it is only a proof of results for this assignment)

Install the required Python packages:
##### pip install -r requirements.txt

##Running the Program

### 1. Expanding the Face Dataset:
Set Up the Dataset
In dataset/, make sure you have folders like Person1/, Person2/, etc. Each person’s folder must have at least 10 face images (.jpg or .png).

### 2. Train the Face Recognition Model
Open a terminal in the project directory and run: 
##### python train_model.py

This will train the model and save it to model/eigenface_pipeline.pkl.

### 3. Run Real-Time Face Recognition
Make sure your webcam is connected.
Then run:
##### python main.py

A window will open showing your webcam feed. 
When a face is detected, it will draw a box and label the recognized person’s name.

Press 'q' on your keyboard to quit.
